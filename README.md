steps to be folllowed
-----------------------
. Create a Spring Boot Application (https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/)
. The pom.xml File - Define Maven Dependencies
. Project Structure
. Configuring MongoDB database
. Creating the Employee Model
. Create a Spring Data Repository - EmployeeRepository.java
. Creating the APIs - EmployeeController
. Exception handling in RESTFul web services
. Running Spring boot application

after the Steps we need to Test REST APIs Using Postman Client or we can use any other like Swagger UI, Insomnia REST Client, Paw, Apigee, and cURL

in this module We are using Postman as the client to test the CRUD operations

install PostMan (https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

Perform -- CRUD
test it in Mongodb through URl
